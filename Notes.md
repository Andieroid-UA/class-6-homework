# Class 6 Homework

## What we reviewed

### *JavaScript this Keyword Explained Simply*

Learned about "this" statements and how to apply them to functions with scopes. Additionally reviewed a video on the shorthand form of return functions:

### *Classes and Object Oriented Programming (OOP) video*

Object Oriented Programming: One style of programming that fits most needs but does not solve all problems. Another tool for JS, used only when we need it. It's a model that organizes software design around data, or objects rather than functions and logic.

Other kinds of programming involve functional (reduce in arrays, etc.), logic, event-driven, and more!

- A way to manage and think about state
- Models interactions within and between states
- Based on the concept of "objects"
- "Objects" have data and code associated to them

(this type of programming is not limited to JavaScript)

#### IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:

**JS is NOT A TRADITIONAL OOP language**

Object Oriented Programming 4 main ideas

1. Inheritance
When a class derives from another class. The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class. In addition, it can have its own properties and methods. An inherited class is defined by using the extends keyword.

2. Encapsulation
In object-oriented programming (OOP), encapsulation is the practice of bundling related data into a structured unit, along with the methods used to work with that data. Most OOP languages implement encapsulation primarily through classes and the objects instantiated through those classes.

3. Abstraction
Abstraction is the process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world. Abstraction is used to describe things in simple terms. It's used to create a boundary between the application and the client programs.

4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming languages that allows a specific routine to use variables of different types at different times. Polymorphism in programming gives a program the ability to redefine methods for derived classes.

#### JavaScript Specifics
- JS is NOT a "traditional" OOP language
- "Classes" are built on top of Prototypes
- We have an actual "Object" type in JS
- We can "simulate" most/all of the core OOP concepts

---------------------------------------------------------------
#### Addtl. Notes
- Classes are technically new, as of 2017
- constructors can be used as a function (method in a class). But can use it as any other function. No let/const don't need to worry about it
- you can add a custom method to a method (speak phrase --> to each player/constructor)
- there are MANY ways to put 

## Summary
Class, Properties and Syntax versus the new function (keyword) and the class methods as well as how prototypes work
